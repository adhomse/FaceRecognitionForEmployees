# FaceRecognitionForEmployees
Detect and Recognize the faces for employees


Face recognition is a technique that involves determining if the face image of any
given person matches with any of the face pictures from tagged stored information.
Face Recognition is natural, straightforward to use and monitor, additionally doesn't
require any special input from the person ahead of the camera. The best means of
doing Face recognition is by opting one-shot learning technique. One-shot learning
aims to learn info regarding object classes from one, or solely a couple of pictures.
The model still must be trained on uncountable information; however, the dataset is
any, however of a similar domain. In a unit of ammunition means of learning, you'll
be able to train a model with any face datasets and use it for your information that is
incredibly less in number. Here we've got used Facenet as a one-shot model.

# Triplet Loss
We have to build a Face Recognition system which will capture real-time images of
employees when they come in front of the camera with the help of computer vision
techniques like OpenCV and model detects the position of the face in the frame
using Haar Cascade then it will recognize that face using Face Recognition model
i.e., Facenet. After we Recognize the face, we get the Name and the present time,
which will be forwarded to EMS and attendance will be marked.
